  # E-Commerce Back End (ORM)

  ## Description:
  The motivation behind this project was to create the back end for an e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies. This project uses Express.js and Sequelize to interact with MySQL. The Dotenv npm package is used to keep sensitive information private. <br /><br />  For future development of this project, I would like to refactor the post and put methods in the starter code of the product-routes.js to async/await with try/catch.
